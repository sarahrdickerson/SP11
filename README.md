## Introduction

Ailegro stands at the forefront of innovation in music composition, leveraging AI to provide users with a seamless platform for their musical creativity. Our aim is to create an accessible yet versatile music production application that balances simplicity for beginners and hobbyists with advanced features for further tuning, thereby widening access to quality music production for a broader audience. Our application is capable of creating personalized music for our users through the use of four different AI models: MusicGen, Riffusion, Loop Test, Dance Diffusion. Additionally, Ailegro has an incorporated chord recognition model that enables automatic recognition and analysis of chord progressions within compositions.
